Certainly! Let's create a **README** for your **GitHub repository** related to the **Test Automation Hybrid Framework** developed using **Page Object Model (POM)** and **TestNG**. Below are the essential sections you can include in your README:

# Test Automation Hybrid Framework using POM and TestNG

## Overview
This repository contains a **Hybrid Framework** for **Selenium** test automation. The framework combines elements of both the **Data-Driven** and **Keyword-Driven** approaches, resulting in a flexible and maintainable structure.

## Key Components
1. **Page Object Model (POM)**: We organize our test scripts using the POM pattern. Each page or component of the application has a corresponding Page Object class. These classes encapsulate the interactions with the UI elements, making the code more readable and maintainable.

2. **TestNG Framework**: We use TestNG for organizing and executing our test cases. TestNG provides features like parallel execution, test grouping, and reporting capabilities.

3. **Excel Sheets for Test Data**: Test data is read from Excel sheets at runtime. This allows us to separate test data from the test scripts, making it easier to update and manage.

4. **Version Control with Git and GitHub**: We use Git and GitHub for version control. This ensures that changes are tracked, and collaboration among team members is streamlined.

5. **Continuous Integration with Jenkins**: Jenkins is used to automate the execution of our test scripts. It helps us achieve continuous integration and ensures that tests run automatically whenever code changes are pushed.

6. **Reporting with Extent Reports**: Extent Reports generate detailed test results, including screenshots and logs. These reports provide insights into test execution and help identify issues.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/manjunathnp/SwagLabsTestAutomation-TF.git
   ```

2. **Set up your test environment** (e.g., install necessary drivers, configure browser settings).

3. **Install the required dependencies** (e.g., Selenium, TestNG).

4. **Update the Excel sheets with your test data**.

5. **Execute the test suite using TestNG**.

## Customization and Extensions
Feel free to customize the framework based on your specific project requirements. Here are some additional features you can consider adding:

- **Custom TestNG Annotations**: Create custom annotations to enhance test case organization and execution.

- **Reusable Utility Classes**: Develop utility classes for common functions like logging, handling waits, or interacting with databases.

- **Parallel Execution Strategies**: Explore parallel execution options within TestNG (e.g., parallel by methods, classes, or suites).

- **Integration with Cucumber or BDD Tools**: Extend the framework to support behavior-driven development (BDD) using tools like Cucumber.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or have questions, refer to the [FAQ](FAQ.md) or reach out to the community via GitHub discussions.
